## When to use

When exploring the codebase to understand how something works or to plan an implementation.

## Workflow

1. Start from the entry point relevant to the question
2. Trace through imports and function calls
3. Summarize findings: what exists, what's missing, what patterns are used
4. Don't modify any files — this is read-only exploration
